# **1. Introduction**

## **1.1. Problem Statement**

- Conversion of videos in English language into our national language( Hindi language) such that it can reach a wider audience of the country.

## **1.2. Project Overview/Specifications**

- The project proposes the use of neural machine translation techniques to convert the videos in English language into Hindi language.
- The technique involves the steps as follows:
  - Input : Video in English language
  - Process :
    - Fetch audio from video
    - Convert audio to text
    - Translate english text to hindi text
  - Output: Hindi text

## **1.3. Motivation**

- India is a multilingual country where more than 1600 languages are spoken belonging to more than 4 different language families; with Hindi being the national language.
- This beauty of language transcends the boundaries of the different states and cultures in our country. Learning a language other than the mother language is a huge advantage. But a path to multilingualism is a never ending process for most of the people of our country.
- Majority of the population of our country finds it difficult to communicate in English and understand English language videos. So, translation of such videos can become useful.
- Furthermore, by converting visual content(i.e. videos) into understandable language(here, hindi) becomes an important step for understanding the relation between visual and linguistic information which are the richest interaction modalities available to humans.

# **2. Literature Review**

## **2.1. Existing System**

- Rule Based Machine Translation(RBMT)
  - These models are based on the idea of use of available dictionaries and rules of a particular language for translating into another language.
  - These models are prepared manually leading to need of large human task force who can understand both the languages( i.e. linguists)
- Example Based Machine Translation(EBMT)
  - These models are based on the idea of using the available set of translations to continue the translation from one language to another.
  - These models have the limitations of having a limited number of examples being available.
- Static Machine Translation(SMT)
  - Word based
    - Comparing similar words in both languages and understanding the pattern by doing the same operation a number of times using the concept of bag-of-words.
    - This model had a limitation of not being able to consider the order of the words within a sentence,
  - Phrase based
    - Comparing similar phrases in both languages and understanding the pattern by doing the same operation a number of times using the n-gram model.
    - This model also had limitations of not being able to consider the order of phrases within a sentence.
  - Syntax based
    - Use of the subject, the predicate, other parts of the sentence, and then to build a sentence tree using language syntax along with rest of word and phrase translation for translation from one language to another.
    - Complexity of model increased with large amount of dataset consisting of numerous sentences.
- Neural Machine Translation(NMT)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN)
    - RNN are used to reorder the source to target language translation by the help of semi-supervised learning methods.
    - Word embedding is used to generate the vector value of the words which can be used for translation purposes.
    - RNN are based on the idea of binary tree structure for mapping the word in the target language with the vector values of the source language.
    - This model has a complex structure which in turn leads to more number of computations.
  - Long Short-Term Memory Networks(LSTM)
    - LSTM works on the idea of sequence by sequence learning.
    - It uses a NMT model which has eight layers of encoders and decoders within a deep neural network.
    - It is also known as Bidirectional RNN because of the use of encoder and decoder structure.
    - Encoder-Decoder structures are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probabilities of the target sequence given the input sequence.

## **2.2. Proposed System**

- LSTM model
  - This model is a special kind of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies.
  - The model mainly consists of steps:
    - Decide the information to pass through the cell state
    - Decide what information to store in the cell state
    - Update the cell state by adding new information and discarding the information no longer needed
    - Predict the output based on the information

_Figure 1-LSTM architecture._ ![](RackMultipart20210505-4-h5s5ok_html_197acd18a683d56f.png)

## **2.3. Feasibility Study**

- Comparison between RNN and LSTM
  - Gated Recurrent Units(GRU) gating values are close to LSTM values with lesser run time in comparison to RNN.
  - The LSTM layer architecture is built in a way such that the network &quot;decides&quot; whether to modify its &quot;internal memory&quot; or not, at each step.
  - Doing so, and if properly trained, then the layer can keep track of important events from further in the past, allowing for much richer inference.
  - LSTM networks were made with the purpose to solve long term dependency problems that traditional RNNs have.
  - LSTM networks are specially made to solve long-term dependency problems in RNNs and they are super good at making use of data from a while ago (inherent in its nature) by using cell states and RNN has a complex structure which in turn has more computations therefore making LSTM more preferred over RNN.

# **3. System Analysis &amp; Design**

## **3.1. Aim**

To implement a model which can perform word-by-word translation of a given english sentence into hindi with accurate results.

## **3.2. LSTM Architecture details**

- The LSTM reads data one sequence after the other.
- If the input is of length &#39;k&#39; then it will read it ask time-stamps
- The main aim is to bring long and short term dependencies
- The whole system is simplified by 3 Gates and 1 state:
  - Forget Gate: This gate will decide that information should be passed from previous state (h(t-1)) to next state (h(t)) or not
  - Input Gate: This gate deals with the data to update the cell states
  - Output Gate: This decides the information that is relevant to next hidden state
  - Cell state: The pointwise addition of the output of Forget and Input gate updates cell state
- Input tokens are represented by {x1,x2,...,xk}, hidden states by {h1,h2,...,hk}, cell states by {c1,c2,...,c3} and output token by {y1,y2â€¦,yk}.

LSTM consists of 3 neural network architectures.

- Encoder
- Decoder Train Mode
- Decoder Inference Mode

###

### **3.2.1. Encoder**

- Encoder basically summaries the whole sentence
- The inputs for the encoder are feature vectors of each word of the sentence which is shown in the figure
- After embedding inputs to the encoder, it will generates hidden and cell states at each time and gives final outputs y1, y2, ..yk
- In this project, the hidden and cell states are only stored and outputs are discarded because the states are helpful to store the summarized sequence till the previous state. For this application the states are only needed

![](RackMultipart20210505-4-h5s5ok_html_56f1546a837ea60d.png)

_Figure 2-Encoder Model._

### **3.2.2. Decoder**

#### 3.2.2.1. Decoder Train Mode

- This accepts the final states of encoder as the input states
- Then getting word start\_ and it starts generate word
- At the next instance, We give actual Hindi translation words as input form training labels and it will again predict the next word (Shown in the below figure).
- This uses &quot;Teacher forcing method&quot;

![](RackMultipart20210505-4-h5s5ok_html_c1f06141e9d0941a.jpg)

_Figure 3-Decoder Train M __odel__._

#### 3.2.2.2. Decoder Inference Mode

- In this application we need slightly different architecture for output testing Decoder.
- As we don&#39;t have labels for testing purposes, we need to pass the predicted word to the next timestamp&#39;s input (Shown in the below figure).

![](RackMultipart20210505-4-h5s5ok_html_2a1ad904b219ccc8.jpg)

_Figure 4- __Decoder Inference Model__._

## **3.3. Impact of system**

- Video marketing can be even more effective overseas.
- Translation helps in cutting across language barriers and interacting with people in such countries.

## **3.4. Dataset**

- Bilingual corpora
- Part of parallel corpora which contains multiple corporas.
- Taken from about 37726 TED talks, news articles, Wikipedia articles.
- Has unique 1,24,318 english records and 9,7662 hindi records
- Corpus link: [HindiEnglishCorpora](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11858/00-097C-0000-0023-625F-0)
- Cleaned dataset
- It is sentence tokenized (sentence aligned)

![](RackMultipart20210505-4-h5s5ok_html_892918f045fe66a4.png)

_Figure 5-Dataset Sample._

## **3.5. Preprocessing**

- Removal of duplicate and null records
- Conversion to lowercase
- Removal of Quotes, Special characters, extra spaces
- Computing the length of english and corresponding Hindi sentence, append it in the dataset
- Dictionary of all the words of Hindi and English
- Adding &#39;START\_&#39; and &#39;\_END&#39; tokens to the Hindi labels, such that decoder can understand starting and end of the sentences

## **3.6. Word Embedding**

- For feature vector representation, there are many techniques like word embedding, word2vect, etc.
- Here word embedding is used to represent word features and it can be implemented using Keras API in python
- In embedding, there are certain features which are extracted automatically from the text. In which if the number of words is n and the number of features is m then the matrix will be the size of mxn

![](RackMultipart20210505-4-h5s5ok_html_aa8ab437f8e9b311.png)

_Figure 6-Word Embedding Sample._

- In the above example, n=10K and m=50.
- The features are like gender, royal, kind etc.
- For word which having any particular feature has High value in the matrix
- As King, Queen, Man, Woman all can relate to Gender. So their corresponding values are High but Man is not related to Royal. So that value is near to zero

_Figure 14-BLEUscore code snippet._

## **3.8. Testing**

For testing the applications like Neural Machine Translation, BLEU algorithm is used

BLEU score:

- Bilingual evaluation understudy
- Number between 0-1
- The number indicates how much similar the predicted text is to reference text
- 1 indicates the maximum similarity
- It can be using Unigram, bigram,... or the combination of any(Here 2 and 4-gram cumulatives are used)
- The algorithm is mentioned above

Example: **Reference 1** : The cat is on the mat.

**Reference 2** : There is a cat on the mat.

**Predicted Output** : The cat the cat on the mat. (Target)

Bigram BLEU Score Computation

| **Possible Bigrams** | **Frequency in**  **Target Sentence** | **Actual frequency from the reference sentences** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the cat | 2 | 1 |
| cat the | 1 | 0 |
| cat on | 1 | 1 |
| on the | 1 | 1 |
| the mat | 1 | 1 |

_Table 1-BL __EU score computation example table__._

- Our total count is 2+1+1+1+1=6
- Actual count is 1+0+1+1+1=4
- Bleu score = count/total = 4/6

## **3.9. System Deployment**

As the system is divided into steps:

- Uploading the video in English language
- Video to audio conversion
- Audio to text conversion
- English text to Hindi translation
- Displaying the Translation
